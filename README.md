## Misc binaries

App versions are mostly: [Socat 1.7.3.2](http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/), [NetCat 1.10](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nc110/) and [BusyBox 1.2.2](https://busybox.net/)

ARM and MIPS builds made with: https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/ using "[scripts/compile.sh](scripts/compile.sh)" on Debian Squeeze running inside qemu and using "10.0.2.2" (qemu host) for file locations downloaded on the host to avoid HTTPS errors.

See "[files.md](files.md)" for info about each file.

See also [hypn/docker-misc-binaries](https://github.com/hypn/docker-misc-binaries) for even more useful binaries, more likely to be run on a local machine than these ;)
